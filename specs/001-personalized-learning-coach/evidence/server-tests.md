| Command | Exit | Result |
|---|---:|---|
| `pnpm --filter @en/server exec jest --runInBand` | 0 | 36 suites, 156 tests, 1 snapshot passed |
| `pnpm --filter @en/server exec jest --config apps/ai/test/jest-e2e.json --runInBand` | 0 | 10 suites, 45 tests passed |
| `NODE_OPTIONS=--experimental-vm-modules COACH_E2E_DATABASE_URL=<localhost-test-url> ... pnpm --filter @en/server exec jest --config apps/server/test/jest-e2e.json --runInBand` | 0 | 2 suites, 4 isolated legacy-flow tests passed |
| `pnpm --filter @en/server exec jest --runInBand apps/ai/test/evals/coach-eval-deterministic.spec.ts apps/ai/test/evals/coach-eval-runner.spec.ts` | 0 | 2 suites, 13 evaluation/gate tests passed |
| `pnpm --filter @en/server exec eslint <Coach/learning paths> --quiet` | 0 | Feature production and test paths passed; the repository-wide lint still reports four unchanged pre-existing errors outside this feature |

The 2026-09-08 review reran the server and AI builds, all Coach unit/e2e/eval
suites, and the non-database legacy regressions. The disposable PostgreSQL
regression was not rerun because `COACH_E2E_DATABASE_URL` was not configured;
its 2026-09-03 isolated run above remains the latest database evidence.

The quickstart form `pnpm --filter @en/server test -- --runInBand` was also attempted. The repository's existing script forwards the extra `--` as a Jest filename pattern, so it collected zero of the 35 discovered files and exited 1. Direct invocation above is the equivalent working command and is the authoritative result.

Coverage includes contracts, authorization, ownership, controlled graph paths, tool boundaries, grading-before-save, idempotency, cancellation, timeouts, budgets, cost, Trace, redaction, retention, deletion, 60 synthetic evaluation cases, and real AppModule regression against disposable PostgreSQL/Redis.
