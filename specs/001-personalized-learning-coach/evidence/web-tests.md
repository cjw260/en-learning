Browser scenarios cover isolated synthetic fixtures, safe tool progress, authoritative final results, 410 durable reconciliation, timeout, budget exhaustion, explicit network retry, saved grading state, cancellation, and legacy home/dictionary/course/settings/generic-AI routes. The DOM assertions reject sensitive canaries and do not render Prompt/tool arguments; legacy navigation emits no Coach API request.

The unit suite, TypeScript check, production build, and 10-test Chromium
selection were rerun during the 2026-09-08 code review. The trace-on artifact
run in the table remains the retained 2026-09-03 evidence and was not repeated.
